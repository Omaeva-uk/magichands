Until I attended a course of treatment from Magic hands physiotherapy. I would recommend Sundar to anyone. He is very empathetic and this really has made a difference to my daily life. I've got one treatment to go but it's 85% better than it was. I'm hoping for even more by the time the last one is done.",
